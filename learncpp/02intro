programs written in high level languages must be translated into machine language before they can be run. There are two primary ways this is done: compiling and interpreting
C++ programs are usually compiled 


C++, java, python is case sensitive
SQL and HTML is not case sensitive


to run first complile:
- g++ -o firstprogram firstprogram.cpp
- then./firstprogram



Your compiler is using C++17 (language standard code 201703L)
