video 2:

variables:
int 4 byte
char 1 byte
float 4 bytes
bool 1 byte
double 8 bytes

these are called primitive datatypes
arrays and such are non-primitive which we'll talk about later









TypeCasting:

two types: conversion and TypeCasting

conversion is implicit process aka the compiler does in
like if we wanna fit a small data type in a bigger data
like int into double
or converting character into int
like A if put into an int is gonna be 65 as A's askii value is 65


casting is explicit. 
means programmer does this manually

used for converting big to small data type

example:

double price = 200.99
int newPrice = (int)price;

cout newPrice will give us 200









OPERATORS:

arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
relational: <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
Logical: OR ||, AND &&, NOT !

UNARY OPERATORS:
increment: ++
decrement: --

a++ paila kaam paxi update
++a paila update paxi kaam







Conditional Statements

if-else:

if (n>0){
    cout << "n is positive\n";
} else {
    cout << "n is negative\n"; 
}
